When you run Ispell,
it remembers what words you’ve added to your “personal dictionary”.
Unfortunately,
most of those words are real words
in ordinary English.
Why should all of us add them to our dictionaries separately?

If you use `flyspell-mode` in Emacs ≤22,
you’re using Ispell.
If you also use Unix,
this tiny package
will let you share the work of adding modern words
(“memristor”, “hyperlinks”, lowercase “internet”)
and acronyms
(“IRC”, “IrDA”, “URL”)
with other users of Ispell.
